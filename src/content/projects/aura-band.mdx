## Technical Highlights

- Co-founded and lead the development of Your Accessible Flight — an AI-powered mobile platform empowering people with disabilities to travel barrier-free by verifying mobility aid compatibility (wheelchairs, scooters, etc.), providing detailed airport/airline accessibility info, and planning stress-free journeys (beta available on iOS at youraccessibleflight.info).
- Built two distinct product versions end-to-end:
  - B2C app for individual passengers — modern Swift/SwiftUI on iOS + Kotlin/Jetpack Compose on Android, with Firebase backend for real-time personalization, user profiles, and secure data handling.
  - B2B version tailored for airlines, airports, travel agencies, and partners — enabling integrated accessibility tools, data insights, and customized services to improve compliance and passenger experience at scale.
- Own all technical, architectural, and product decisions as CTO in a 4-person founding team; delivered the full product lifecycle (ideation → MVP → beta launch) while personally developing both mobile apps and driving the ongoing migration from Firebase to a custom backend for better scalability, privacy, and cost control.
- Pioneered cutting-edge AI features to advance accessibility: launched an intelligent chat assistant with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for personalized, context-aware guidance; actively exploring autonomous agents for internal operations and computer vision models to detect/analyze damaged mobility equipment via device camera — turning the app into a proactive travel companion.
- Secured EU-country grant funding and won multiple startup/innovation contests as a high-impact accessibility solution; positioned the dual B2C/B2B model for broader adoption, social good, and sustainable growth in the travel industry.
