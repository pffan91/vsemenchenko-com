## Technical Highlights

- Led the development of three major mobile applications from scratch as part of a new mobile team build-out:
  - Architected and delivered a dedicated Apple TV app for immersive motorsport content consumption (Formula 1, MotoGP, NASCAR, etc.), collaborating closely with CEO and CTO on strategic features and priorities.
  - Built a completely new flagship iOS app focused on news, live results, photos, videos, and race hub functionality.
  - Rewrote a legacy React Native-based app into a fully native Swift implementation (Android counterpart in Kotlin by team), resolving performance, stability, and maintenance issues from the unsupported cross-platform stack — resulting in a more reliable, high-quality user experience.
- Mentored the entire mobile team (iOS and Android developers) during rapid growth phase; guided multiple juniors to mid-level proficiency through hands-on coaching, code reviews, pair programming, and technical leadership — accelerating team velocity and skill development in a fast-paced media environment.
- Established foundational engineering processes from the ground up for the newly formed mobile team: implemented PR workflows, code review standards, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing practices, release management, and App Store submission flows — creating scalable, professional dev operations that supported consistent, high-quality deliveries.
- Authored comprehensive technical documentation for the mobile organization, including architecture guidelines, best practices, coding standards, and component libraries for both iOS and Android — ensuring long-term maintainability, consistency across platforms, and smoother onboarding for future team members.
