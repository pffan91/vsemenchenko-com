## Technical Highlights

- Architected and built a high-performance custom charting & plotting engine entirely from scratch using Core Graphics, delivering industry-leading speed and responsiveness for real-time crypto data visualization; enabled rapid development of new chart types and features, accelerating iteration cycles and earning strong user praise for superior performance compared to competitors.
- Designed and single-handedly owned the development, launch, and ongoing optimization of the app's flagship real-time trading interface — handling orderbook, candles, tick charts, positions, and user data synced at 100–250 ms intervals in high-load environments; achieved zero crashes on these core screens, buttery-smooth performance even on legacy devices, and established it as the primary selling point driving user retention and competitive differentiation.
- Spearheaded the large-scale migration of a legacy UIKit codebase to modern SwiftUI + Combine architecture; successfully refactored >50% of the application into modular, declarative components — resulting in crash-free sessions reaching 99.8%, App Store rating climbing to 4.7/5 (from prior levels), dramatically improved maintainability, and faster feature delivery.
- Led end-to-end feature development for 4 major releases (plus numerous high-impact smaller features including revamped onboarding, in-app Notes, advanced Settings, and custom views); collaborated closely with backend/API teams to refine endpoints and UX — each major feature drove approximately 40% uplift in subscriptions and active user base, significantly contributing to overall platform growth.
- Personally achieved ~50% code owning across the entire project; maintained rigorous code quality as a senior contributor with 12+ years of experience, conducting thorough code reviews, mentoring other developers, leading technical discussions, and consistently delivering clean, scalable PRs that raised team standards and reduced technical debt.
