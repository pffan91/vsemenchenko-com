## Technical Highlights

- Single-handedly architected and developed the core iOS companion app from scratch for the AURA Band wearable (bioimpedance-based body composition & hydration tracker); implemented comprehensive unit tests (>80% coverage) and UI tests (>50% coverage), ensuring robust, maintainable code from day one.
- Delivered the full-featured Apple Watch companion app with deep HealthKit integration for seamless syncing of activity, heart rate, and custom body metrics (fat/muscle/hydration), enabling users to track advanced health insights directly on-device.
- Engineered reliable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication stack between the AURA Band hardware and iOS app; handled real-time data transmission, device pairing, firmware updates, battery monitoring, and error-resilient syncing — critical for accurate, low-latency body composition measurements.
- Played a pivotal leadership role during the high-visibility CES 2019 launch; worked extended hours (12–16 hours/day) to support cross-functional teams, deliver rapid OTA updates, resolve live issues on the show floor, and ensure flawless demos — contributing directly to successful product unveiling and early market traction in the competitive wearable space.
- Mentored developers, conducted thorough code reviews, merged high-quality PRs, and fostered best practices in a fast-paced startup environment; helped scale the team’s output while maintaining clean, testable architecture under tight deadlines.
